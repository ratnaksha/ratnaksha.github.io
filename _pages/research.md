## Reconciling Abyssal Ocean Turbulence using Theory and In-Situ Observations <br/>
The deep overturning circulation of the ocean is driven by northward flow of cold waters formed in the Southern Ocean and diffusion-driven upwelling from oceanic turbulence, both of which are difficult to measure and quantify accurately. This study aims to reconcile different methods of measuring the overturning in a large ocean basin by 1) inferring mixing required to sustain the overturning using long term observations of inflow and outflow heat fluxes from a time-dependent heat budget, 2) direct/indirect observations of mixing within the basin. While our results show consistency of the basin-averaged mixing estimates from several different methods, this study also highlights the need to make sustained oceanic observations of mixing and circulation to further reduce uncertainty in the estimates.
