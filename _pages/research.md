## Reconciling Abyssal Ocean Ciculation and Turbulence from Theory and Observations <br/>
The deep overturning circulation of the ocean is driven by northward flow of cold waters formed in the Southern Ocean and diffusion-driven upwelling from oceanic turbulence, both of which are difficult to measure and quantify accurately. This study aims to reconcile different methods of measuring the overturning in a large ocean basin by 1) inferring mixing required to sustain the overturning using long term observations of inflow and outflow heat fluxes from a time-dependent heat budget, 2) direct/indirect observations of mixing within the basin. While our results show consistency of the basin-averaged mixing estimates from several different methods, this study also highlights the need to make sustained oceanic observations of mixing and circulation to further reduce uncertainty in the estimates.

## Development of Data Processing Pipeline of Novel Oceanic Turbulence Instrumentation 
Understanding the processes that control the temporal variability and geographic distribution of ocean mixing is an important community goal towards obtaining more accurate global climate predictions.  Until recently direct observation of deep-ocean mixing has required special free-falling profiling instruments, and because of this, mixing observations are sparse.  This paper describes a relatively new technique for obtaining ocean mixing by measuring very small-scale temperature fluctuations during traditional CTD profiling.  We show that the method is not significantly biased, which provides support for making continued observations within the global repeat hydrography programs.
