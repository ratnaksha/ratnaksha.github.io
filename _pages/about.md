 Hello! Welcome to my webpage. This is still work in-progress!  <br />   
 
# About me
 
* I am a PhD Candidate in Physical Oceanography at [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/), [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu) advised by [Dr. Sarah. G. Purkey](https://spurkey.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/) 
 
* My research interests lie in the area of large-scale dynamics of the oceans and its link to the global climate system. I'm also interested in harnessing machine learning and deep learning tools to improve intelligibility of climate related model and observational data. 
 
* My dissertation revolves around understanding two fundamental processes regulating the overturning circulation of the ocean- 
  - the role of turbulent mixing in the abyssal ocean  
  - spatial and temporal variability in the dynamics of deep and abyssal flows in the ocean
 
 * I use direct observations from novel instrumentation called [X-pod](http://mixing.coas.oregonstate.edu/research/instrumentation/) to measure oceanic turbulence for the goal of improving our knowlendge of the global geography of turbulent mixing in the ocean. My research also utilizes satellite observations of changes in the Earth's gravitiational field and consequently Ocean Bottom Pressure from [NASA GRACE](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/Grace/index.html) and [GRACE-FO](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/Grace/index.html) missions as well as state estimates from [NASA ECCO](https://www.ecco-group.org/) and the Southern Ocean State Estimate [(SOSE)](https://http://sose.ucsd.edu/) to understand the inter-annual spatial and temporal variablity in abyssal ocean mass transport.
